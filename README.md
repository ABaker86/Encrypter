# Encrypter
Is a basic encryption tool. That has a log of bugs. If you think you can make it better please send in your code.

# Bugs Fixed

- Now checks if the file exists
- Now checks the password is right

# Bugs

- Crashes because the encrypted file is being used by the tool. so if you want to decrypt the file after encrypting it you have
to close the program and open it again. (if you know how to fix this then please send in your code.)

- To many text boxes i want a button to select a file to encrypt and decrypt.
